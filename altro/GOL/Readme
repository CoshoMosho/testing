1. Included files:

gol_threads.c 	: C Pthread implementation of Game of Life
gol_openmp.c  	: C OpenMP implementation of Game of Life
Makefile	: Makefile to compile the sources and create executables
Random		: Text input file with random alive cells (dimensions=80x25)
Shapes		: Text input file with shape followin cells (dimensions=80x25)
Readme		: Info file
GOLReport.pdf	: Project report
Measures.xls	: Excel sheet with measurements

2. How to compile:

	Untar the files:
	tar xvfz GameOfLife.tar.gz
		
	Run make to compile the sources:
	make

	Call the executables:
	./executable OPTIONS

	executable : GOLPT or GOLOMP accordingly
	OPTIONS:
		-n : Number of threads (Default 1)
		-h : Boards height (Raws) (Default 25)
		-w : Boards width (Columns) (Default 80)
		-f : Input file (In default mode should give one)
		-b : Bench mode

ps1. Console dimensions should be set above width x height+4 in order to have a full view of the board.
     In too large dimensions the board is not printed in console and is available only in bench mode.
ps2. Screen is refreshed with the result of next round approximately every 1/2 sec.

3. Enjoy the play! :)
